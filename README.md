# Paddy Leaf Disease Detection
## A Convolution Neural Network Model To Detect Different Types Of Paddy Diseases.
### Paddy, the raw grain before removal of husk, gets affected by several diseases & pests which leads to loss of the yields by up-to 70%.
### So itâ€™s very important to identify the disease during the initial stages.
### I am implementing paddy disease detection technique using CNN algorithm, so that we can detect and cure the paddy disease before it completely destroys the grain.
### The Dataset for this project is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/paddy-disease-classification)

### Flow of project:
```
Data Collection
Splitting data into Train, Test & Validation
Data augmentation
Reshaping Images
Creating best suited CNN Model for the Dataset using trial and error method
Saving the Model 
```
